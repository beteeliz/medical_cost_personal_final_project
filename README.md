# Medical Cost Personal Final Project
## Introduction
Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz serves as an introductory guide to machine learning using R. While the datasets necessary for the book's exercises are not available online without purchasing the book, they are in the public domain and can be cleaned and recoded for use. More information here.
The primary dataset includes variables such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges, and aims to address the challenge of accurately predicting health insurance costs. This dataset is available [Visit Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

## Objectives of Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz:
* Introduce readers to machine learning concepts using the R programming language.
* Guide users through data preparation, including cleaning and recoding datasets.
* Explore the use of real-world datasets to predict insurance costs.
* Explain key variables such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoking, region, and charges in the context of health insurance.
* Provide practical exercises and examples to demonstrate machine learning applications in predicting medical costs.

## Tools Used:
